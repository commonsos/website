    <div>
        <div>The  integral Revolution is a deep and comprehensive transformation of all parts of society, including its values and structure. The new, self-managed society is based on autonomy and the abolition of all forms of domination: the state, capitalism, patriarchy, and all other forms that affect human relationships and with the natural environment. Conscious and strategic actions are needed to compost the obsolescent structures and recover those values and qualities that enable us to live a life in common. As the most promising entry point for the collective change we see a new economic system (link to economic system page), as this is giving people the opportunity to finally exit the vicious circle of capitalism and to get more space for new ideas without boundaries.</div>

export const Disobedience = () => (
    <div>
        <div>Disobedience implies, to some extent, to disobey certain laws or demands from dominant structures. Sometimes this becomes even a civil duty when the law is considered wrongful. To understand this we refer to the difference between legal and just. Certain rules and laws might be legal on paper but cannot be considered just, which is often the case under repressive, fascistic or totalitarian governments. This can also indirectly or directly apply to western states, for example, when a government uses common taxes to finance "lawful" war of aggression against other countries and its civil society.</div>

export const Cooperativism = () => (
    <div>
        <div>We follow and support the basic guidelines of cooperatives as they are driven by their participants, and based on self-aid, self-responsibility, equality, equity, democracy, and solidarity.  Everybody participate actively and equally in making decisions and setting policies. The accumulated capital, mainly through value increase of our currency Faircoin, is primarily reinvested in the development of the ecosystem related projects. This way participants can have access to a growing amount of goods and services within the ecosystem and with more self-empowering tools.</div>

export const Decentralization = () => (
    <div>
        <div>One of our aims is to have decentralized organizational models of decisions and roles. By decentralizing our technology we prevent a central point of failure and thus, that any authority or state can shut us down. This way we want to make sure that all participants can communicate, share ideas, work on projects or transact value without repression or censorship. For the political part, distribution of political and economical power prevents abuse of roles with unique rights or access and thus, preventing fraud, corruption or takeovers.</div>

export const Stateless = () => (
    <div>
        <div>Capitalist modernity depends on the nation-state system, which in turn hangs from a patriarchal and hierarchical collective mindset, deeply forged over centuries of humans oppressing humans. For the first time in history a combination of political awareness, weakness of the capitalist economy, and p2p chriptographic technology allows us to present serious and realistic alternatives to the current governing models. A global cooperative financial system gives us free and fair markets, a huge step forward. If this is combined with an unbreakable set of ethical values based on freedom, and democratic decision-making protocols, it starts to sound as a reality.<br />If you believe life outside the state is possible, join (link to your nearest node, or something) Faircoop today.</div>
